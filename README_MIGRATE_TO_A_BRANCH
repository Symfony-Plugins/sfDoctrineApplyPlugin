Unless it is your goal to experience the joys of bleeding edge development, you should
changes your svn:externals for sfDoctrineApplyPlugin to:

http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfDoctrineApplyPlugin/branches/1.1

That branch will receive only bugfixes and maintain the current "Zend Mailer and sfDoctrineGuardPlugin 1.4 compatibility" behavior you know and love.

There is also a 1.2 branch which will use SwiftMailer and sfDoctrineGuardPlugin's current trunk, which has its own email address and full name fields and therefore doesn't necessarily require a separate profile table.
